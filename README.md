# CT-Kernel-Reconstruction

This project aims to develop a neural network architecture for CT Kernel Reconstruction. Here, we initially generate a target image, and then use the Neural Network to study the features and feature differences between a high-resolution image obtained from a "hann" kernel and a low-resolution image obtained from a "hann50" kernel. The datasets were custom made on MATLAB with derivations from The Cancer Imaging Archive's (TCIA) Abdomen CT Dataset.
